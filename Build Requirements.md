Build Guidance

Requirements:

1. org.jdesktop.layout.GroupLayout

2. org.jdesktop.layout.LayoutStyle

All the dependencies can be found in swing-layout-1.0.4.jar

If you use NetBeans IDE, It works well.

if you use Eclipse or other IDE, you need to load the dependencies.

If compile from command line, please specify the swing-layout-1.0.4.jar as follows:

javac -classpath .;swing-layout-1.0.4.jar MainFrame.java
